# Chess
A project to let people view their chess stats via API to learn and improve


The first few steps in this project are the following:
1. Create a way to access chess.com api via the website [X]
2. Display basic data from the api [X]
3. Start with EDA for the data accessed: This has been started
    Interesting charts to create:
    1. Rating over time (broken out by type) [x]
    2. Wins and losses and draws by opening (can change which type with dropdown?) [x] created a low level version that can/should be improved eventually
    3. Wins and losses and draws by day of week (can change which type with dropdown?)
    4. Wins and losses and draws by time of day (can change which type with dropdown?)



These are meant to be small steps as the following is true:
