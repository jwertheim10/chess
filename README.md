# Chess
A project to let people view their chess stats via API to learn and improve


The next few steps in this project are the following:
1. Create a way to access chess.com api via the website
2. Display basic data from the api
3. Find a way to integrate jupyter into website
4. Start with EDA for the data accessed

These are meant to be small steps as the following is true:
